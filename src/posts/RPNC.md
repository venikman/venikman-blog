## Reverse Polish notation calculator

This is another way to do calculation. Even now some of modern calculators
support this notation. But where I have learned it? Haskell! Yes, by reading
book about Haskell I was able to learn this new thing.

From [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation) we can see
that this is notation where operators (`-`, `+`, `*`, `/`) follows by operands
(simple way to explain it is: numbers). Here is some of expamples:

```
4 5 + // 4 + 5

1 5 - // 1 - 5
10 1 5 + 2 * - // 10 - ((1 + 5) * 2)
```

I am not sure if I will have any other chance to learn this notation on other
situation. But this is very interesting thing where by trying to learn as my
primary goal, which is learn new programming language Haskell I can get bonus
like this.
