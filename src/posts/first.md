# Beginning

Hello there! I am starting this blogging journey because I am using Deno a tech
stack for it and I want to try do some learning in public. I will be posting
here anything that relevant for my personal grows.

It is not planning to be tutorial base blogs. I will be more about how I am
learning, what I am using to get better and some random opinions about
everything. Definitely learning by doing (for my opinion) is the best approach
and I am talking this on next level. **publicity** . Will see how it will play
out.

I am planning to write in Russian and English. Tech, personal grows, finances.
For now I have single reader - me in the future. I hope you will enjoy reading
it later Stas.
